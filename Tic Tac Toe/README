Background: A very basic Tic Tac Toe game. This was the first project that I created using ReactJS. It was used primarily for the main functionality, mostly to create the squares. 

* A priority was taken for functionality over UI. 


How to Run:
1. Download the entire folder, with the base.html file and the style.css. Then, just open up the base.html file and you can play. 

Limitations: 
1. As UI was not prioritized, I have not yet moved the buttons to the actual gameboard and created functionality knowing when someone wins the game.
2. At some point, the introduction of a Square class would be effective so we could just create the objects and have one general functions to change from "-" to "X" and "O"
