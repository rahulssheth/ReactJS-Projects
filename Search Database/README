README: 

A search filter for recruiters to parse easily through the students on the NXTPitch Website. The idea is that this would be a
key feature on the Web App version of NXTPitch. For the companion project, see my NXTPitch Repo or see https://feed.nxtpitch.com
For this project, I used various builtin functions, such as map and filter, to set up the page. 




How To Run: 

This can be run in a similar method to the other projects. Simply download the entire folder and open up the base.html file in Chrome. 

Limitations:

1. The next step would be to integrate this with the Firebase backend I used for the mobile app to build a more sophisticated filter, based on things like skills, etc.
2. Another way to link to the individuals website would probably be better. I used a string concatenation method which, although it works, may not be the best idea.
