README: 

A search filter for recruiters to parse easily through the students on the NXTPitch Website. The idea is that this would be a
key feature on the Web App version of NXTPitch. For the companion project, see my NXTPitch Repo or see https://feed.nxtpitch.com
For this project, I used various builtin functions, such as map and filter, to set up the page.
