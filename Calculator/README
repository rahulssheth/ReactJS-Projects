README: 


Background: A simple 4 function calculator, with basic multiplication, addition, subtraction, and division operations. In this project, I learned more about ReactJS functions and how to pass parameters over to functions on OnClick commands. 

How to Run: Download the entire folder and open it in Google Chrome (most browsers should work, but this was developed and checked with Chrome).


Limitations: 

1. Some of the UI could be better. 
2. I ran into an error where I could not change the input button to an actual button for the submit and clear functions. Maintaing all as the same
would be more effective should I need to make UI changes in the style.css. 
3. Possibly adding more functions would be exciting.
